## Literature Review
### Interaction between Polymeric Aluminum Hydroxide with Fluoride
When hydrolyzed, polyaluminum based coagulants, one of which is polyaluminum chloride, form mono- and polymeric species [(Gebbie, 2001)](http://wioa.org.au/conference_papers/2001/pdf/paper6.pdf). The interaction between aluminum hydroxide polymer and fluoride leads to the formation of several insoluble and soluble products depending on the ratio of total fluoride ion and aluminum ion concentrations, pH, and the total applied fluoride and aluminum concentrations [(Parthasarathy et al., 1986)](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/v94-310). When pH is less than 4, the predominant fluorocomplex is AlF due to the complete dissociation of polymeric aluminum. When the ratio of total fluoride ion and aluminum ion concentrations is between 0.5 and 1, fluoride is observed to precipitate, replacing some of the hydroxide ions ions in the aluminum hydroxide polymer. When the ratio of total fluoride ion and aluminum ion concentration is greater than 3, there is both precipitate and dissolved complexed fluoride present. It was observed that the optimal conditions for precipitating fluoride was a hydroxide to aluminum ratio of 2.5, a fluoride to aluminum ratio of 0,7, and a pH between 4 and 7.

### Mechanisms Governing Removal of Fluoride
Of the potential mechanisms that may play a role in the removal of fluoride with polyaluminum chloride, including surface adsorption, coprecipitation, and precipitation, it appears that coprecipitation is the main mechanism [(Kowalchuk, 2011)](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1059&context=ce_etds). Coprecipitation is the contamination of a precipitate by an impurity that is otherwise soluble under the conditions of precipitation [(Randtke in Kowalchuk, 2011)](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1059&context=ce_etds). Occlusion and surface adsorption play major roles in this process.

### Interactions Among Fluoride, NOM, and Alum During Coagulation Process
Experimental results from jar tests illuminate mechanisms of behind fluoroaluminum complexation [(Herrboldt, 2016)](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/39194/HERRBOLDT-THESIS-2016.pdf?sequence=1). When fluoride was present in the system with alum, the residual aluminum increased significantly, indicating that fluoride is likely forming a soluble fluoroaluminum complex. In the removal of fluoride, NOM caused a decrease in fluoride removal  from 50.1% to 45.8%, whereas NOM removal was inhibited by the presence of fluoride, indicated that it is likely outcompeting NOM for complexation with aluminum or adsorption to aluminum solids. In the precipitation of aluminum with fluoride, the particles are concentrated at smaller particle diameters, perhaps suggesting that fluoride may be inhibiting flocculation by acting as a stabilizing agent or by inhibiting precipitation. It is hypothesized that fluoride prevents the growth of precipitates by inhibiting interactions between hydroxide and nearby particles. It is also hypothesized that, due to the way that fluoride can replace hydroxide in solids (Hao and Huang in [Herrboldt, 2016](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/39194/HERRBOLDT-THESIS-2016.pdf?sequence=1)), the formation of aluminum hydroxide complexes is disrupted.

### pH Dependence of Fluoride Removal
In a study by Gong et al. (2012), fluoroaluminum complexation was found to exhibit pH dependence. At pH values less than 5.0, almost all fluoride existed as fluoro-aluminum complexes, inhibiting its removal by coagulation. At pH levels greater than 8.0, fluoride almost exclusively as free fluoride, indicating that hydroxide has a greater affinity for aluminum at a higher pH [(Herrboldt, 2016)](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/39194/HERRBOLDT-THESIS-2016.pdf?sequence=1).

### Collection and Analysis of Fluoride samples
An Ion-Selective Electrode (ISE) fluoride probe is used to measure the fluoride concentration of a sample. The following quality-control procedures should be followed.

ISE fluoride probes can only detect solubilized fluoride, and would give inaccurate readings in the presence of Fe3+ and Al3+, such as in cases where polyaluminum chloride is added to the system. Total Ionic Strength Adjusting Buffer (TISAB) solution is added to samples to solubilize the fluoride in the sample and keep the sample at a constant pH of 5-5.5. Temperature should be kept constant with less than a 1 degree Celsius deviation [(EPA Method 9214)](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/documents/9214.pdf).

Polyethylene containers, rather than glassware, should be used, as fluoride can adsorb to glass. An Initial Calibration Verification standard and a Continuing Calibration Verification standard should also be used, consisting of solutions of known fluoride concentration within the mean expected fluoride concentration that should be tested. The ICV should be used to test the accuracy of the calibration curve and the CCV should be sued after every 10 samples to ensure that the fluoride probe has not drifted from the calibration curve. These controls should be within 10% of their known values. A control blank containing one part water and one part TISAB should also be used to enhance the accuracy of data in future experiments.

## Methods
### Experimental Apparatus
The gravity-powered apparatus was constructed as according to the fabrication manual in the Fluoride Gravity Fall 2018 report.

Several changes were made to optimize the ease of use of the apparatus. The IV drip chamber was removed due to previous difficulties in starting the system, The T-joint was removed, allowing the fluoride constant head tank to be directly connected to the flocculator.

**Figure 1:** New connection linking the fluoride constant head tank with the flocculator.

In place of the IV drip chamber, microbore tubing connected to the PACl constant head tank was used to drip PACl directly in the fluoride constant head tank at a constant rate, mixing with the fluoride and beginning the coagulation process. This change allowed the PACl and fluoride systems to become decoupled.

**Figure 2:** Microbore tubing connected to the PACl system allows PACl to drip directly into the fluoride constant head tank.

The system was tested with red dye in place of PACl and water to determine the extent of mixing, and it was observed that the fluoride constant head tank became a homogenous red mixture, coloring the waste line red as well, implying that the dye was able to be well mixed in the fluoride constant head tank under this new construct.

### Determining the Effectiveness of New System
#### Determining Coagulant Flow Rate
The flow rate of PACl was determined to have a linear relationship with the height differential between the fluoride constant head tank and the PACl constant head tank by the [Fluoride Gravity Fall 2018 team](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride_Gravity/blob/master/Fall%202018/Fluoride_Grav_Fall2018_Report.md#measuring-coagulant-flow-rate).

It was hypothesized that the decoupled PACl system would exhibit the same linear relationship with the change in height. The flow rate of the coagulant was determined by measuring the change in mass of the PACl stock tank over a period of time. This was then converted to volumetric flow rate. The balance was connected to ProCoDa to measure the change in mass.

**Figure 3:** The flow rate of the PACl system was plotted against the change in height between the fluoride constant head tank and the PACl constant head tank. The data exhibits a strong positive correlation, indicating a direct relationship between flow rate and change in height.

The strong correlation implies that the relationship in the decoupled system operates in the same manner as the previously linked system.

#### Determining Binding of PACl
The system was run in reverse, with red dye run through the PACl system to determine the extent of mixing. PACl solution was added to the fluoride system to determine the extent of coagulation and whether the solution would successfully flocculate. The system was run with a upflow velocity of 0.76 mL/s.

The red dye appeared to coagulate at the surface of the constant head tank. The water entering the flocculator was less red than the water in the constant head tank, implying that precipitation occurred in the constant head tank, disallowing flocculation to occur.






<!---## Results and Analysis
Present an observation (results), then explain what happened (analysis).  Each paragraph should focus on one aspect of your results. In that same paragraph, you should interpret that result.
In other words, there should not be two distinct paragraphs, but instead one paragraph containing one result and the interpretation and analysis of this result. Here are some guiding questions for results and analysis:

When describing your results, present your data, using the guidelines below:
* What happened? What did you find?
* Show your experimental data in a professional way.

```python
import aguaclara.research.procoda_parser as pp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

time, influent_turbidity, effluent_turbidity = pp.get_data_by_time(
      path="Data", columns=[0, 3, 4], start_date="6-14-2018",
      start_time="15:40", end_time="23:30")
elapsed_time = (np.array(time)-time[0])*24

fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()
ax1.set_xlabel("Time (hours)")
ax1.set_ylabel("Effluent Turbidity (NTU)")
line1, = ax1.plot(elapsed_time, effluent_turbidity, color="blue")

ax2 = ax1.twinx()
ax2.set_ylabel("Influent Turbidity (NTU)")
ax2.set_ylim(60,120)
line2, = ax2.plot(elapsed_time, influent_turbidity, color="green")

plt.legend((line1, line2), ("Effluent", "Influent"))
plt.savefig("Turbidity.png")
```

### Figure requirements
 - Create the graph using python (not Excel)
 - If the x axis is time then make zero time reflect the beginning of the test.
 - Use a white background for all graphs.
 - Most data will have both x and y values and thus should be presented using an xy scatter plot.
 - Label all axes and include units where appropriate.
 - Axis scale labels should be in the margin of the graph and not inside the graph border.
 - Eliminate parts of the range in both x and y axis that aren't used or that aren't meaningful.
 - Place a caption with a brief description below the graph. Add this caption using the wiki formatting, not in your graphing software.
 - Use data symbols to show data points unless there is so much data that the symbols overlap. If the data symbols overlap it is better to connect the data points with a line and not show the data symbols.
 - When presenting multiple plots on a single graph make sure that it is easy to distinguish the plots using the legend.
 - If curve fitting is used explain why and include the equation (elsewhere in the report).
 - If a model or theoretical curve is presented it should be a smooth curve without data points.
 - Use the same font in the graphs as you use in the text of the report.
 - Insert the graph in your report after the first reference to it in the text. Inserted the graph after the next paragraph break
 - Scale the size of the graph so it is large enough to see the data and read the text without having to follow a link to see a larger image. Avoid using hyperlinks on images because that causes the export to Microsoft Word option to not include the image.

After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?-->
