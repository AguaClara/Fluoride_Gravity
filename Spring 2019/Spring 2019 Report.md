## Abstract
Fluoride contamination of water is a significant issue faced by nations and people across the globe, and can **[Careful when using language like this, especially in a research report where it may not even be necessary. I would suggest removing "within multiple developing nations like India" as it does not add value to your report anyway.]**, lead to adverse consequences on health (e.g. muscle weakness and atrophy, weakness, fatigue). The Fluoride Gravity team’s **[Do not capitalize "Team". Team is not part of your name. You are the Fluoride Gravity team not the Fluoride Gravity Team.]** objective is to develop a cost-effective, self-sufficient mechanism for extracting excess fluoride from drinking water. The Spring 2019 team hopes to further the gravity-powered system’s efficacy and potentially begin to run field-tests with the device. **[Wording could be more formal (i.e. "The objective of the Fluoride Gravity team is..." or "to further the efficacy of the gravity-powered system's...")]** The application of such a device in real-world scenarios will be predicated upon success seen with the aforementioned field tests.

**[Very concise abstract. You use this section well!]**

## Introduction
The majority of AguaClara plants are located in Central America, where the sources of surface water originate from rivers and mountain streams. AguaClara's mission of providing access to safe drinking water for all has motivated the AguaClara team to expand and develop new goals **[I don't think we have any plants where their source is a lake... we focus on rivers and streams from mountains. Also, consider switching the ordering of your sentence to allow the paragraph to flow better. I.e. start with saying that the majority of AguaClara plants are in Central America and then mention that AguaClara's mission of providing access to safe drinking water for all has motivated us to expand and develop new goals.RESOLVED]**. By considering and analyzing the differences in drinking water collected from groundwater sources in other regions around the world, AguaClara can serve communities outside of Central America who are deprived of access to safe drinking water.

At some locations where there is little to no fluoride in drinking water, fluoride is added in for the purpose of strengthening teeth and deteriorating natural deposits [(NYC DEP, 2016)](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/pdf/wsstate16.pdf). However, there are detrimental consequences when there is an excess concentration of fluoride in the water being consumed by inhabitants in the area. For example, there has been moderate to high fluoride pollution in regions such as Algeria, Thailand, Ghana, India, and Iran, whose major source of drinking water comes from groundwater sources. The pollution of groundwater in these regions is due to the mobile dissolution of fluorite, apatite, and topaz from weathered rocks, increasing the levels of fluoride in the groundwater [(Bhattacharya and Samal, 2018)](http://www.isca.in/rjrs/archive/v7/i4/6.ISCA-RJRS-2018-028.pdf). The effects of consuming excess fluoride include dental, skeletal, developmental, neurological, endocrine, reproductive, and carcinogenic issues that affect the health of the communities in areas of high fluoride concentrations [(Bhattacharya and Samal, 2018)](http://www.isca.in/rjrs/archive/v7/i4/6.ISCA-RJRS-2018-028.pdf). Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) regulated the concentration limit for fluoride in drinking water to be 1.5 mg/L [(Water-related diseases, 2016)](https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases-risks/diseases/fluorosis/en/).

In India, the Bureau of India Standards set an upper limit of fluoride concentrations in drinking water to be 1 mg/L [(Bureau of India Standards, 2012)](https://archive.org/details/gov.in.is.10500.2012). However, more than 65 million Indians consume drinking water above the recommended limit of 1.5 mg/L and some locations in India contain up to 20 mg/L, which risks the health of many communities [(LeChevallier and Au, 2004)](https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/9241562552/en/).

AguaClara aspires to achieve the recommended limit of 1 mg/L or lower by the Bureau of India Standards and to implement the gravity-powered system of fluoride removal into the communities with excess concentrations of fluoride. The Fluoride Gravity team will be testing the gravity-powered apparatus with PACl and red dye substituted as fluoride to optimize fluoride removal to achieve residual concentration of less than 1 mg/L. If the gravity-powered fluoride removal apparatus operates in the optimal conditions of removing fluoride to a concentration of 1 mg/L, feasibility analysis on site will be performed to test whether the system can be used in the communities in India, which will allow AguaClara to provide access to safe drinking water in India and other locations that obtain water from groundwater sources.

**[Great Intro! Sums up your purpose very well.]**

## Literature Review
### Interaction between Polymeric Aluminum Hydroxide with Fluoride
When hydrolyzed, polyaluminum based coagulants, one of which is polyaluminum chloride, formed mono- and polymeric species [(Gebbie, 2001)](http://wioa.org.au/conference_papers/2001/pdf/paper6.pdf). The interaction between aluminum hydroxide polymer and fluoride led to the formation of several insoluble and soluble products depending on the ratio of total fluoride ion and aluminum ion concentrations, pH, and the total applied fluoride and aluminum concentrations [(Parthasarathy et al., 1986)](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/v94-310). When pH was less than 4, the predominant fluorocomplex was AlF due to the complete dissociation of polymeric aluminum. When the ratio of total fluoride ion and aluminum ion concentrations was between 0.5 and 1, fluoride was observed to precipitate, replacing some of the hydroxide ions ions in the aluminum hydroxide polymer. When the ratio of total fluoride ion and aluminum ion concentration was greater than 3, there is both precipitate and dissolved complexed fluoride present. It was observed that the optimal conditions for precipitating fluoride was a hydroxide to aluminum ratio of 2.5, a fluoride to aluminum ratio of 0,7, and a pH between 4 and 7.


### Mechanisms Governing Removal of Fluoride
Of the potential mechanisms that may play a role in the removal of fluoride with polyaluminum chloride, including surface adsorption, coprecipitation, and precipitation, it appeared that coprecipitation is the main mechanism [(Kowalchuk, 2011)](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1059&context=ce_etds). Coprecipitation is the contamination of a precipitate by an impurity that is otherwise soluble under the conditions of precipitation [(Randtke in Kowalchuk, 2011)](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1059&context=ce_etds). Occlusion and surface adsorption played major roles in this process.

### Interactions Among Fluoride, NOM, and Alum During Coagulation Process
Experimental results from jar tests illuminated mechanisms of behind fluoroaluminum complexation [(Herrboldt, 2016)](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/39194/HERRBOLDT-THESIS-2016.pdf?sequence=1). When fluoride was present in the system with alum, the residual aluminum increased significantly, indicating that fluoride is likely forming a soluble fluoroaluminum complex. In the removal of fluoride, the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) caused a small decrease in fluoride removal from 50.1% to 45.8%, whereas NOM removal was greatly inhibited by the presence of fluoride [(Herrboldt, 2016)](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/39194/HERRBOLDT-THESIS-2016.pdf?sequence=1).  **RESOLVED: [What is NOM? Define the terms that you use.]** This indicates that in the removal of fluoride, fluoride was likely outcompeting NOM for complexation with aluminum or adsorption to aluminum solids.

**RESOLVED:[How does this inhibit flocculation? I am having a hard time following.]** In the precipitation of aluminum with fluoride, fluoride was predicted to act in the following manner: since fluoride is a negatively charged species, fluoride must overcome the negative charge repulsion between particles in order to allow for aggregation. In the precipitation of fluoride with aluminum, the disruption of charges due to the negative repulsion stops collisions and ultimately causes particles to be concentrated at smaller particle diameters [(Herrboldt, 2016)](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/39194/HERRBOLDT-THESIS-2016.pdf?sequence=1). In this manner, fluoride may inhibit the aggregation of flocs by acting as a stabilizing agent or by inhibiting precipitation. It was hypothesized that fluoride prevents the growth of precipitates by inhibiting interactions between hydroxide and nearby particles. It was also hypothesized that, due to the way that fluoride can replace hydroxide in solids , the formation of aluminum hydroxide complexes is disrupted.
**RESOLVED: [Wrong way of using citation?? just say Herrboldt, 2016]**

**[Please write more clearly. It is very difficult for me to follow the logic of this section.]**


### pH Dependence of Fluoride Removal
In a study by Gong et al. (2012), fluoroaluminum complexation was found to exhibit pH dependence. At pH values less than 5.0, almost all fluoride existed as fluoro-aluminum complexes, inhibiting its removal by coagulation. At pH levels greater than 8.0, fluoride almost exclusively as free fluoride, indicating that hydroxide has a greater affinity for aluminum at a higher pH [(Herrboldt, 2016)](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/39194/HERRBOLDT-THESIS-2016.pdf?sequence=1).

### Collection and Analysis of Fluoride samples
An Ion-Selective Electrode (ISE) fluoride probe is used to measure the fluoride concentration of a sample. The following quality-control procedures should be followed.

ISE fluoride probes can only detect solubilized fluoride, and would give inaccurate readings in the presence of Fe3+ and Al3+, such as in cases where polyaluminum chloride is added to the system. Total Ionic Strength Adjusting Buffer (TISAB) solution is added to samples to solubilize the fluoride in the sample and keep the sample at a constant pH of 5-5.5. Temperature should be kept constant with less than a 1 degree Celsius deviation [(EPA Method 9214)](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/documents/9214.pdf).

Polyethylene containers, instead of glassware, should be used, since fluoride can adsorb to glass. An Initial Calibration Verification standard and a Continuing Calibration Verification standard should also be used, consisting of solutions of known fluoride concentration within the mean expected fluoride concentration that should be tested. The ICV should be used to test the accuracy of the calibration curve and the CCV should be sued after every 10 samples to ensure that the fluoride probe has not drifted from the calibration curve. These controls should be within 10% of their known values. A control blank containing one part water and one part TISAB should also be used to enhance the accuracy of data in future experiments.

**[Very thorough lit review, but some parts are hard to follow. You use really great vocabulary, but sometimes it doesn't lend itself to helping your points come across clearly. Remember that the purpose of a report is to communicate your research to a general audience.]**

## Previous Work
A coagulant-sedimentation system was developed to extract fluoride from contaminated water. Multiple tests have been run by past teams to analyze the efficacy of the designed filtration system using polyaluminum chloride (PACl) as a coagulant.

The Spring 2016 team continued to develop a more efficient filtration system by testing PACl with clay **[Clay is not a coagulant.] [Define your acronyms. i.e. polyaluminum chloride (PACl)]** [(Longo, 2016)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9yahrdDmfVpQ0t0M2NUUkRRNHM/view). While the team was successfully able to create a floc blanket, the Summer 2017 deemed clay to be not as necessary as it increased the effluent turbidity of the system. **[Clay is not a coagulant... it cannot be compared to PACl. You might benefit from talking to Tigran about this to clear up any confusion.]** [(Akpan et al., 2017)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/FluorideReportSp18.md), and therefore ran tests with just fluoride and PACl. However, it was soon realized that the system would begin to fail after just 10 hours. In conjunction with the Summer 2017 High Rate Sedimentation Team, a new reactor was able to boost the time to failure and allow for increased upflow velocities. It was determined that the most efficient upflow velocity was 1.5 mm/s [(Pang, 2018)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride_Gravity/blob/master/Fall%202018/Fluoride_Grav_Fall2018_Report.md#previous-work). The same team continued to conduct experiments with varying concentrations of PACl in order to develop an absorbance spectrum and determine the most effective concentration of PACl to be delivered to the system.

The 2018 cycle of teams managed to focus on developing a robust, gravity-powered filtration system [(Akpan et al., 2017)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/FluorideReportSp18.md).

<img src="Schematic.PNG">

**Figure 2:** A schematic for the gravity-powered system with differences in height generated power.

Some of the major designs of the model were created by the Spring 2018 team, and focused on deploying float valves to maintain a constant amount of water flowing through the system. Since the concentration of the PACl solution remained constant in the stock tank, a calculation of flow rate provided insight into the concentration of PACl actually entering in the system [(Pang, 2018)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride_Gravity/blob/master/Fall%202018/Fluoride_Grav_Fall2018_Report.md#previous-work).

The Summer 2018 team furthered the flexibility of the filtration system by including sliders for controlling height differences between different tanks and pipes. This provided the ability for teams to adjust the flow rate within the system.

<img src="Diagram.PNG">

**Figure 3:** Adjustments made by the Summer 2018 team to the set-up to allow for height variations. **[Great use of figure here! I like how everything is clearly labeled.]**

The Summer 2018 team continued to conduct tests on varying PACl concentrations and fitted new data to the Langmuir adsorption spectrum created by the Fall 2017 team. Concentrations of fluoride (range: 3 to 20 mg/L) and PACl (range: 10 to 50 mg/L) were tested. A Langmuir isotherm was applied to the data to obtain a new uptake vs effluent model [(Pang, 2018)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride_Gravity/blob/master/Fall%202018/Fluoride_Grav_Fall2018_Report.md#previous-work).

The following equation was used:
 $$ \frac{C_e}{q_e} = \frac{1}{q_e}C_e+\frac{1}{K_L\cdot q_m} $$

where $C_e$ is the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbant, $q_e$ is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium, and $K_L$ and $q_m$ are Langmuir constants which are related to adsorption capacity and energy of adsorption.

**Figure 4:** A Langmuir isotherm fitted with data from the Summer 2018 team.

In Fall of 2018, two teams were made from the original Fluoride team: [Fluoride Gravity](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride_Gravity) worked to make the gravity-powered apparatus more efficient, and [Fluoride Auto](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto) spearheaded the development of an adsorption model by running more bench experiments [(Pang, 2018)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride_Gravity/blob/master/Fall%202018/Fluoride_Grav_Fall2018_Report.md#previous-work).

Finally, the Fall 2018 team prioritized developing a mechanism or process for measuring coagulant flow rate within the system. An IV drip was installed within the filtration system along with microtubing. While headloss still occurred, the team adjusted the height of the coagulant constant head tank to modify flow rate. The drip chamber was noted to substantially streamline the process of measuring flow rate [(Pang, 2018)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride_Gravity/blob/master/Fall%202018/Fluoride_Grav_Fall2018_Report.md#previous-work).

The goal of the Spring 2019 Fluoride team is to modify any necessary parts to the filtration system developed over the past few years by previous Fluoride teams, begin to run comprehensive tests on red-dye within the system, and finally proceed to testing fluoride solutions within the filtration system, itself.

**[At the end of this section, you should be tying the previous work to the goals of your team for this semester. Briefly explain how your team will be building off of previous work.]**

## Methods
### Experimental Apparatus
The gravity-powered apparatus was constructed as according to the fabrication manual in the Fluoride Gravity Fall 2018 report.

Several changes were made to optimize the ease of use of the apparatus. The IV drip chamber was removed due to previous difficulties in starting the system, The T-joint was removed, allowing the fluoride constant head tank to be directly connected to the flocculator.

<img src="IMG_20190209_092106.png">

**Figure 5:** New connection linking the fluoride constant head tank with the flocculator. **RESOLVED: [Consider circling the fitting you are referring to in the figure in red to make it even clearer what connection you are talking about. This can be done on Google Drawings.]**

In place of the IV drip chamber, microbore tubing connected to the PACl constant head tank was used to drip PACl directly in the fluoride constant head tank at a constant rate, mixing with the fluoride and beginning the coagulation process. This change allowed the PACl and fluoride systems to become decoupled.

<img src="IMG_20190209_092113.png">

**Figure 6:** Microbore tubing connected to the PACl system allows PACl to drip directly into the fluoride constant head tank. **RESOLVED: [The micro-tubing here is really hard to see. Same as previous comment, consider circling it in red.]***

The system was tested with red dye in place of PACl and water to determine the extent of mixing, and it was observed that the fluoride constant head tank became a homogenous red mixture, coloring the waste line red as well, implying that the dye was able to be well mixed in the fluoride constant head tank under this new construct.

### Jar Tests
In previous runs of the second redesign of the gravity powered system, it was observed that red dye particles continued to float through the sedimentation tube regardless of its upflow velocity. That is, even when the system was stopped, all of the red dye flocs floated to the top of the sedimentation tube.

To test whether this result was specific to mechanics of flocculation that could perhaps change the properties of red dye flocs, a jar test was conducted, using a magnetic stirrer to rapidly mix the solution to increase collision rates.

Plastic beakers with 420 microliters of PACl was mixed with 400 milliliters of red dye in 400 mL of water. The solution was stirred using a stir bar for 15 minutes before leaving the solution to settle.

This was compared to a solution of red dye-PACl flocs collected directly from the experimental apparatus after flocculation. The flocculator was run at a system concentration of 40 mg/mL of PACl, which was mixed with red dye. The solution after flocculation was added to a beaker initially containing 200 milliliters of water to simulate conditions in the sedimentation tank. The flocculation solution was added to the beaker it was roughly the same color as the first independently created solution. The solution was not stirred and was allowed to settle directly after the addition of flocs.

## Results and Analysis
### Determining the Effectiveness of New System
#### Determining Coagulant Flow Rate
The flow rate of PACl was determined to have a linear relationship with the height differential between the fluoride constant head tank and the PACl constant head tank by the [Fluoride Gravity Fall 2018 team](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride_Gravity/blob/master/Fall%202018/Fluoride_Grav_Fall2018_Report.md#measuring-coagulant-flow-rate). It was hypothesized that the decoupled PACl system would exhibit the same linear relationship with the change in height. The flow rate of the PACl entering the decoupled fluoride system was determined in two different methods: gravimetrically and volumetrically.

#### Gravimetric Method: First Redesign of System
The flow rate of the coagulant was determined by measuring the change in mass of the PACl stock tank over a period of time. This was then converted to volumetric flow rate. This was mode of measurement was conducted only with the first redesign of the system. The balance was connected to ProCoDA to measure the change in mass. The volumetric flow rate of the PACl coagulant entering the fluoride system was measured at several height differences (Figure 7).

<img src="PACl vs height gravity.PNG">

**Figure 7:** The flow rate of the PACl system was plotted against the change in height between the fluoride constant head tank and the PACl constant head tank. The data exhibits a strong positive correlation, indicating a direct relationship between flow rate and change in height. **RESOLVED: [Refer to your figure in the body of this section so that if someone is skimming through your report, they can easily pinpoint which figure goes with what information.]**

The slope of the best fit line of the flow rate of the PACl system versus the difference in height between the fluoride constant head tank and the PACl constant head tank graph was calculated to be 7.9*10^(-4) mL*s^-1*cm^-1, demonstrating the flow rate of PACl flowing into the fluoride system increases by 7.9*10^(-4) mL/s per cm of height difference raised.

#### Volumetric Method: Second Redesign of System
Using a 10 mL graduated cylinder, the flow rate of the PACl entering the fluoride system was also determined by measuring the time the PACl coagulant took to drip into the fluoride system to a volume of 2 mL. This was only conducted with the second redesign of the system. The flow rate of the PACl entering the fluoride system was measured while varying the height difference between the fluoride constant head tank and the PACl constant head tank and doing three trials for each height difference. The data also exhibits a strong positive correlation indicating a direct relationship between flow rate and the difference in height between the coagulant constant head tank and the fluoride constant head tank (Figure 8).

<img src="PACl vs height volume.PNG">

*Figure 8:* The flow rate of the PACl system versus the difference in height between the fluoride constant head tank and the PACl constant head tank graph displaying a strong correlation between flow rate and change in height.

The slope of the best fit line of the flow rate of the PACl system versus the difference in height between the fluoride constant head tank and the PACl constant head tank graph was calculated to be 1.28*10^(-3) mL*s^-1*cm^-1, which demonstrates the flow rate of PACl flowing into the fluoride system increases by 7.9*10^(-4) mL/s per cm of height difference raised.

The strong correlation implies that the relationship in the decoupled system operates in the same manner as the previously linked system with the IV drip chamber.

#### Comparison Between Gravimetric Method and Volumetric Method
The value of the coefficient of determination, R^2, was higher in the volumetric analysis graph (Figure 8) than the R^2 value of the gravimetric analysis graph of the PACl flow rate versus height (Figure 7). Therefore, the volumetric method's data is more accurate due the mass balance's accuracy was confined to the hundredths place which decreased the accuracy of the data measurement as miniscule droplets of PACl are released per minute compared to the large volume of PACl stock solution resting on the mass balance. Also, the mass balance scale only measured the change in mass when the float valve in the constant PACl head tank opens, which gives inaccurate results as the float valve opens only when the water level drops. The mass does not change when the water level is level with the valve. Therefore, the change in mass is not constant which provides inaccuracy in the measurements.  However, the gravimetric method used ProCoDA and a mass balance with automated time and mass readings while the volumetric analysis was estimated with the human eye and timed manually, which accounted for human error. As a result, several trials were done to increase the accuracy and precision of the measurement of the volumetric flow rate of PACl entering the fluoride system.

The determination of the coagulant flow rate was used to control and optimize the concentration of PACl entering the fluoride system.

#### Determining Binding of PACl: First Redesign of System
The system was run in reverse, with red dye run through the PACl system to determine the extent of mixing. PACl solution was added to the fluoride system to determine the extent of coagulation and whether the solution would successfully flocculate. The system was run with a upflow velocity of 0.76 mL/s.

The red dye appeared to coagulate at the surface of the constant head tank. The water entering the flocculator was less red than the water in the constant head tank, implying that precipitation occurred in the constant head tank, disallowing flocculation to occur.

### Conditions for Flocculation
In the first redesign of the system in which the microbore tubing dripped directly into the fluoride constant head tank, it was observed that no flocs or precipitates were observed when the system was run at the previously successful effluent flow rate of 0.76 mL/s. It was observed that the water exiting the effluent line had a large red dye concentration, suggesting an inability of PACl to bind with red dye at this high velocity.

When the system was run at 0.10 mL/s, a significantly lower velocity, small precipitates were observed. However, when the system was run at 0.13 mL/s, very large precipitates were observed in the flocculator (Figure 9).

<img src="floc 224.gif">

**Figure 9:** At an effluent flow rate of 0.13 mL/s, flocculation was able to occur in the first redesign of the gravity powered system.

The implications of this result are the following:
The system must be run at a sufficiently low velocity that binding is able to occur but at a sufficiently high velocity that the number of collisions are maximized.
The system was sensitive to minute changes in the effluent velocity, indicating that there was a narrow optimal range with which the system was able to properly function.

The ideal concentrations of PACl was thought to be modelled by the following Python program:
```python
import math as m
import numpy as np
from aguaclara.play import*
#Input your concentrations you want your system to run at and the upflow velocity in your sed tube
Conc_PACl_exp = 40 * (u.milligram / u.liter)#PACl concentration in your experiment
upflow_velocity = 1.5 * (u.millimeter / u.second)
#Change the above parameters for what you want in your experiment
#Input your concentrations of your stock tanks
Conc_PACl_stock = 1000 * (u.milligram / u.liter)
Conc_fluoride_stock = 100 * (u.milligram / u.liter)

D_sed_tube = 1*u.inch
Area_sed_tube = np.pi*(D_sed_tube**2)/4
Q_system = Area_sed_tube * upflow_velocity
Q_system.to(u.milliliter/u.second)
Q_PACl = (Q_system * Conc_PACl_exp / Conc_PACl_stock).to(u.milliliter/u.second)
print(Q_PACl)
Q_fluoride = (Q_system-Q_PACl)
conc_fluoride_exp = Conc_fluoride_stock * Q_fluoride / Q_system
print(conc_fluoride_exp)
```
In the second redesign of the experiment, this Python program was used to determine the ideal flow rate of PACl using an ideal concentration of PACl through the system, which was then mapped to the correct height using Figure 7. It was previously found that the ideal PACl concentration ranged from 10 mg/L to 50 mg/L; thus, the experiment was selected run at a system concentration of 40 mg/L of PACl. The calculated flow rate of PACl that yielded this concentration was 0.34 mL/s, which corresponded to a height of 10cm (Figure 8). Under these conditions, it was found that a effluent flow rate of 0.48 mL/s yielded the largest flocs (Figure 10).

<img src="floc 310.gif">

**Figure 10:** At an effluent flow rate of 0.48 mL/s and PACl flow rate of 0.34 mL/s, large flocs were observed in the flocculator of the second redesign of the system.

However, more tests must be done to conclude whether the ideal experimental concentrations of PACl correspond with the determined concentrations of PACl modelled by the Python program, and how the concentration of PACl through the system and the effluent velocity work together to cause flocculation.

### Jar Testing
With the independently mixed solution, it was observed that the solution was first homogenous, but after some time, small particles similar to flocs were observed to form. When these flocs were allowed to settle, the majority of these flocs settled to the bottom, with only a small amount of flocs remaining on the surface of the water.

On the other hand, with the solution collected from the flocculator, it was observed that the majority of the flocs rose to the top of the solution rather than sinking (Figure 11).

<img src="jar 310.gif">

**Figure 11:** The mechanics of the red dye are shown. The beaker on the left contains the solution acquired after flocculation and the beaker on the right contains the solution created through rapid stirring.

When both solutions were stirred once more with a magnetic stir bar, both solutions behaved in the same way. The majority of particles then settled, with a few floating to the top.

This seems to suggest that the flocculation process causes the water to act in a different manner than in normal mixing. It is hypothesized that a difference in pH may prevent mixing and the proper settling of flocs.
