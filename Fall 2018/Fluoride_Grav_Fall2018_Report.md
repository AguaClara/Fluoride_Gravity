## Abstract

Fluoride contamination of drinking water is a common public health issue in some regions of the world such as India. The fluoride team's overarching goal is to create low cost, compact, and sustainable solutions to fluoride contamination in drinking water. The fall 2018 Fluoride Gravity team aims to simplify the design of a gravity powered fluoride removal research apparatus that would allow current and future research teams to easily conduct fluoride removal experiments in the field.


## Introduction

The expansion of AguaClara Cornell technology to new places around the world, like India, has uncovered new challenges and prompted new goals. The bulk of AguaClara plants that have been constructed to date are located in Central America where surface waters, such as rivers and lakes, are a major source of water for AguaClara purification plants. These waters have high turbidities due to sediments, Natural Organic Matter (NOM), and other particulate matter. In addition, these waters also carry biological contaminants that can pose serious health threat to those who consume it without proper treatment.

Contrast to Central America, 85% of the Indian population obtains their drinking water from groundwater sources such a wells and aquifers. Compared to surface water, groundwater has a much lower turbidity due to natural filtration processes which use the soil and underlying rock material to filter particulate matter from water. While this natural filtration process is capable of removing undissolved particulate matter and pathogenic microorganisms, it also allows minerals and metals to leach from the surrounding geological landscape into the groundwater. The types of contaminants seen in the water of one region depend heavily on the types of parent rock material and soils found in that region. Therefore there is a lot of variability between regions when it comes to contamination of groundwater with agents such as fluoride.

India is geographically located on one of a number of Fluoride Belts that exists around the world. These are expanses of land that are geologically rich in fluoride and therefore have a much greater capacity to leach fluoride into groundwater. According to the World Health Organization, one of these belts stretches from Syria through Jordan, Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Sudan, and Kenya, while another starts in Turkey and goes through Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, India, Northern Thailand, and China [(Water-related diseases, 2016)](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases-risks/diseases/fluorosis/en/). India alone contains about 14% of the total fluoride deposited on the earth's crust  [(Mondal, Dutta, & Gupta, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10653-015-9743-7). The coupling of high groundwater fluoride concentrations with a high population dependency on groundwater for consumptions has produced a serious public health problem that needs to be addressed.

There are a number of public health implications associated with both underconsumption and overconsumption of fluoride. One of the risks associated with low exposure to fluoride is an increased development of dental cavities. The American Dental Association has set the recommended concentration of fluoride in drinking water to 0.7 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ in order to prevent the onset of dental cavities [(ADA, 2017)](https://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/fluoride-topical-and-systemic-supplements). As a result, fluoride has become a common additive to municipal water systems in places such as the United States, where there is little to no fluoride naturally present in the water. New York City, for example, adds fluoride to its water in order to achieve a concentration of 0.7 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ in its effluent water supply [(NYC DEP, 2016)](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/pdf/wsstate16.pdf). There are, however, a number of health risks associated with the consumption of fluoride at higher concentrations.

The World Health Organization has set an absolute limit on the concentration of fluoride in drinking water to 1.5 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ in order to minimize the negative impacts of elevated fluoride on human health. Dental fluorosis, the mildest condition caused by the over consumption of fluoride, can begin with water concentrations above 0.9 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$. Skeletal fluorosis, a much more serious condition, can begin to develop at fluoride concentrations above 3 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$. Lastly, at concentrations above 10 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$, crippling skeletal fluorosis will begins to occur  [(WHO, 2004)](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/fluoride.pdf). The number of cases of dental fluorosis, the mildest indicator of excessive fluoride, varies across India, but has been shown to range from 13-91 percent of the total population of some regions [(Arlappa et al., 2013)](http://www.ijrdh.com/files/11.Fluorosis.pdf). In total, it is estimated that 66 million people in India are consuming fluoride contaminated water [(Arlappa et al., 2013)](http://www.ijrdh.com/files/11.Fluorosis.pdf). While there is no established mean fluoride concentration in Indian groundwater, concentrations in some extreme cases have been measured as high as 20 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ in some regions, but most frequently are below 5 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ [(LeChevallier and Au, 2004)](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/9241562552/en/).

The Bureau of Indian Standards has created water quality standards designed to protect the public from the adverse effects of fluoride. They have set the upper limit for fluoride at 1 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$, and the permissible limit in the absence of an alternate source at 1.5 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ [(Bureau of Indian Standards, 2012)](http://archive.org/details/gov.in.is.10500.2012). AguaClara has set its fluoride standards to match the standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standards and therefore will be striving to achieve an effluent fluoride concentration of 1 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ or lower. The team will be experimenting with stock fluoride concentrations up to 20 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ in order to simulate the highest concentrations these filtration systems may encounter out in the field.

The objectives for the 2018 Fall Fluoride Gravity team are to:
1. Improve the system by making it as compact and easy to operate as possible.
2. Match the fluoride removal efficiency of the gravity powered system to that of the automated system.
3. Create a fabrication and operation manual of the gravity for future reference.
4. Increase our general understanding of the mechanisms involved in fluoride removal through a review of available literature.

## Literature Review

#####Review of thesis written by Jonathan Herrboldt titled "Fluoride, Natural Organic Matter, and Particles: The Effect of Ligand Competition on the Size Distribution of Aluminum Precipitates in Flocculation."

This thesis aims to understand the dynamic interactions between fluoride, Natural Organic Matter (NOM), and the aluminum based coagulants used in traditional drinking water treatment processes. Such interactions are important to consider when treating water sources containing significant amounts of NOM and fluoride. While many of the sources of water in India come from wells and therefore their NOM content is generally low, it is still important to know what the interactions between these three particles are. One of Herrboldt's findings was that the presence of fluoride reduced the capacity of water treatment systems to remove other contaminants such as turbidity and NOM due to fluoride's capacity to inhibit aluminum hydroxide precipitation. Additionally, in the presence of fluoride, aluminum precipitates became smaller in size compared to precipitates created in fluoride free solutions. Water with fluoride produced more particles with diameters smaller than 10&mu;m than tests without fluoride. These findings suggest that removal of fluoride can be trickier than just particulate matter due to the difficulty of settling and filtering of smaller particles in the sedimentation and filtration stage of treatment. Tests with both NOM and fluoride also showed similar effects with smaller floc sizes, adding to the difficulty of treatment.

Herrboldt's thesis cited work from Gong et al.(2012) that is particularly important to the fluoride team. In that cited work it was determined that at pH value below 5 nearly all the fluoride present in fluoride and aluminum based coagulant was in the form of a fluoro-aluminum complexation. Such complexation is soluble in water and cannot be removed by coagulation which therefore makes fluoride removal by traditional methods at pH values below 5 unlikely. However, at pH values greater than 8 nearly all fluoride exists freely as fluoride ion, allowing the formation of flocs to occur. A further review of the literature on this matter should be called for by the Fluoride Gravity team. While parameters like pH in the lab can be carefully controlled, pH values out in the field can vary depending on local geology and other chemical factors. Further research about the expected chemistry of groundwater in regions like India would help the team's overall understanding. For example, if pH is rarely observed to be 5 in groundwater then these concerns can be reduced. However, we do not have enough information on this to make such determinations and do not yet fully understand where the critical pH transition points are. Herrboldt does cite another paper by Hu et al. (2005) that found fluoride removal occurred best in a coagulation treatment process when the molar ratio between hydroxide and fluoride was greater than 2.4 [OH<sup>-</sup>]:[F<sup>-</sup>]. More research should done to find other critical pH values for effective fluoride removal with aluminum based coagulants.

Herrboldt in his thesis suspects the formation of fluoro-aluminum complexation is also responsible for an observed increase in residual aluminum concentration. Formation of aluminum hydroxide is negatively affected by the presence of fluoro-aluminum which disallows the formation of larger diameter particles which in return reduces a system's capacity to remove both fluoride and residual aluminum. When comparing experiments that contained aluminum coagulant and NOM mixtures with aluminum coagulant and fluoride mixtures, both of which contained aluminum concentration of 8.0 $\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$, the amount of residual aluminum was found to be 0.058$\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ and 0.244$\mathrm{\frac{mg}{L}}$ respectively. Thus, the results show that residual aluminum concentration increased by nearly an order of magnitude when fluoride was present. These findings are important to the team because it indicates that unintended residual aluminum release in the effluent water supply from our systems can be a concern.



maybe some research on dehalococcoides (bacteria that breaks down fluoride)

## Previous Work

A coagulant-sedimentation process was used to remove fluoride. A series of bench experiments was conducted using polyaluminum chloride (PACl) as the coagulant and varying concentrations of fluoride.

The Spring 2016 team conducted bench tests using clay and PACl, and were able to successfully create a floc blanket. After adding in fluoride, their system was able to remove 85% of the initial fluoride ([Longo, 2016](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9yahrdDmfVpQ0t0M2NUUkRRNHM/view)). The Summer 2017 team determined that the addition of clay was unnecessary, since it caused an increase in effluent turbidity ([Akpan et al., 2017](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/FluorideReportSp18.md)). Thus, the Fall 2017 team ran experiments with only fluoride and PACl, without the addition of clay. They determined that their reactors would fail after 10 hours due to sludge buildup in the reactor. After switching to a new reactor geometry designed by the High Rate Sedimentation 2017 Summer Team (see ["Fabrication Details > Sedimentation Tube"](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/FluorideReportSp18.md) for fabrication details), the time to failure increased, allowing for higher upflow velocities. Thus, the Fall 2017 team determined that a upflow velocity of 1.5 mm/s was optimal for preventing sludge buildup in the reactor. The team then ran experiments with various PACl concentrations to create an adsorption model, which would allow users to determine an optimal PACl dosage for the influent fluoride concentration.

The Spring 2018 team began constructing a gravity-powered apparatus for fluoride removal ([Akpan et. al, 2018](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/FluorideReportSp18.md)).

![gravity_schematic](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/fluoride%20report/Gravity%20Powered%20Reactor%20(2).jpg?raw=true)

Figure 1: Schematic for gravity-powered apparatus. The height difference between the effluent of the sedimentation tank and the fluoride constant head tank (h2) determined the flow rate through the system.

The principle behind the design is that the difference in head between the surface of the constant head tank of the influent and the effluent supplies enough potential energy to cause flow through the system. Float valves in the constant head tanks for fluoride and PACl were utilized to keep the water level and thus, the flow, constant throughout the system.

The Summer 2018 team modified the gravity-powered apparatus fabricated by the Spring 2018 team. Adjustable sliders were added to allow for easy height adjustments of the sedimentation tube, coagulant stock tank, and coagulant constant head tank, and thus adjusting the flow rate of the system (Figure 1) Fabrication details can be found in the [Summer 2018 Final Report](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/Fluoride_Summer2018.md#sedimentation-tube).

Figure 2: Modified gravity powered reactor shown with 3 adjustable sliders.

The Summer 2018 team also ran a series of bench experiments with varying concentrations of fluoride and PACl to create an adsorption model. Fluoride concentrations ranging from 3 to 20 mg/L and PACl concentrations of 10 to 50 mg/L were tested. Experiments were run on the bench setup utilized by previous semesters (Figure 2).

Figure 3: Schematic for bench system.

An adsorption model was created using the data from Summer 2018 by the [Fall 2018 Fluoride Auto team](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto). The effluent concentration of fluoride in mmol/L was plotted against the fluoride uptake (amount adsorbed) in mmol/g. Data points at 1.5 hr were selected from each experiment, at each fluoride and PACl concentration tested.

A Langmuir Isotherm was then fitted to the data, using the following equation:

$$ \frac{C_e}{q_e} = \frac{1}{q_e}C_e+\frac{1}{K_L\cdot q_m} $$

where $C_e$ is the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbant, $q_e$ is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium, and $K_L$ and $q_m$ are Langmuir constants which are related to adsorption capacity and energy of adsorption.

An R-squared value of 0.7611 was observed, indicating a relatively accurate fit of the Langmuir adsorption model and the experimental data. For more information on the adsorption model, see the [2018 Fluoride Auto Final Report](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/Fall%202018/Automated%20System/Fall_2018_Report.md).

In Fall 2018, two fluoride teams were created: [Fluoride Auto](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto) focused on creating an adsorption model by running bench experiments, and [Fluoride Gravity](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride_Gravity) focused on optimizing the gravity-powered apparatus.

## Methods
Explain the techniques you have used to acquire additional data and insights. Reserve fine detail for the Manual at the end of the report, but use this section to give an overview with enough detail for the reader to understand your Results and Analysis. Describe your apparatus, and have a justification for every decision you made and every parameter you chose in the design of the apparatus. Be especially careful to detail the conditions your experiments were conducted under, as this information is especially important for interpreting your results

Below, some example sections are given. Sectioning the report is meant to keep similar information together.  Continue making sections as necessary, or delete sections if you do not need them. Feel free to add subsubsections to further delineate the information. For example, under the Experimental Apparatus section below, the EStaRS team might consider having sections such as "Filter Design" and "Filter Fabrication".

### Experimental Apparatus
Explain your apparatus setup using enough detail such that future teams can recreate your apparatus. Make sure to explain why you built it this way. Create a schematic drawing of the apparatus (not a photo) that has clearly labeled components, flow paths, sensors, and reactor geometry.
* Design (calculations, constraints)

  $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
* Schematic (label parts)

  <img src="https://github.com/jillianwhiting/Jillian-Whiting/blob/master/Images/IMG_0009.jpg?raw=true" height=250 width=200>

* Image (from lab; label parts)
* Materials (dimensions, materials)
* Complications in construction
* If already constructed: write a brief summary of important constraints, include any revisions to apparatus, also reference the prior report where construction is described

### Procedure
Discuss your experimental procedure. How did you run your experiment? What were you testing? What were the values of relevant parameters?

## Results and Analysis
Present an observation (results), then explain what happened (analysis).  Each paragraph should focus on one aspect of your results. In that same paragraph, you should interpret that result.  
In other words, there should not be two distinct paragraphs, but instead one paragraph containing one result and the interpretation and analysis of this result. Here are some guiding questions for results and analysis:

When describing your results, present your data, using the guidelines below:
* What happened? What did you find?
* Show your experimental data in a professional way.
```python
from aide_design.play import*
x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
y = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
plt.figure('ax',(10,8))
plt.plot(x,y,'*')
plt.savefig('/Users/jillianwhiting/github/Jillian-Whiting/Images/linear')
plt.show()
```
![linear](https://github.com/jillianwhiting/Jillian-Whiting/blob/master/Images/linear.png?raw=true)
Figure 1: Captions are very important for figures. Captions go below figures.

### Figure requirements
 - Create the graph using python (not Excel)
 - If the x axis is time then make zero time reflect the beginning of the test.
 - Use a white background for all graphs.
 - Most data will have both x and y values and thus should be presented using an xy scatter plot.
 - Label all axes and include units where appropriate.
 - Axis scale labels should be in the margin of the graph and not inside the graph border.
 - Eliminate parts of the range in both x and y axis that aren't used or that aren't meaningful.
 - Place a caption with a brief description below the graph. Add this caption using the wiki formatting, not in your graphing software.
 - Use data symbols to show data points unless there is so much data that the symbols overlap. If the data symbols overlap it is better to connect the data points with a line and not show the data symbols.
 - When presenting multiple plots on a single graph make sure that it is easy to distinguish the plots using the legend.
 - If curve fitting is used explain why and include the equation (elsewhere in the report).
 - If a model or theoretical curve is presented it should be a smooth curve without data points.
 - Use the same font in the graphs as you use in the text of the report.
 - Insert the graph in your report after the first reference to it in the text. Inserted the graph after the next paragraph break
 - Scale the size of the graph so it is large enough to see the data and read the text without having to follow a link to see a larger image. Avoid using hyperlinks on images because that causes the export to Microsoft Word option to not include the image.

After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?

## Conclusions
Explain what you have learned and how that influences your next steps. Why does what you discovered matter to AguaClara?

Make sure that you defend your conclusions with facts and results.

## Future Work
